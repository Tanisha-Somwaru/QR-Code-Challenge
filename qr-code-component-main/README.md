## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I think I learned how to use boxes quite and to manipulate an image. I found it helpful to breakdown what I needed the box to contain, such as the image and text in this case; doing this had made the code writing process more smoother since I didn't have to deal with different elements not aligning with each other when I was writing the css for the html. I was fascinated by how I could alter the image using max-width, I realized I didn't have to concern myself about using margin for this part since I initially believed the image adjustment would've been more complex then it actually was. 

### Continued development

I feel like I still have a lot to learn about HTML and CSS, but for now, I'd like to keep improving how I use boxes and when it's appropriate to use one. I'd also want to keep practicing with adjusting an image just so i understand more how that works going forward.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Grace-Snow for her help, she gave a lot of helpful pointers for getting started with this challenge. In fact, she actually recommended I started this one as my first challenge on front-end mentor when I was working on a different one that was too complex for where I am at currently. She also helped me out with getting my repository on GitHub so it properly worked with GitHub Pages, I really appreciate her help!
